This is a small library to help you write good benchmarks, via the magic of D's user defined attributes. 

The eventual aim to be able to annotate your data structures and functions with a specific guarantee of a certain asymptotic and amortized (this is important) performance 
guarantees. This is not solely in the running time, but also memory (and anything else you can measure).

The primary intention of the library when benchmarking is to give you the data to process rather than analyse it for you.
By default, for a given number of iterations it will calculate a mean value for you. The mean (say) running time
may not be a particularly useful measure (plot a histogram) 

The library provides mechanisms for measuring more subtle things, for example software OS events and hardware performance counters. 

To avoid messing things up elsewhere, the library doesn't touch your machine (SMT and any frequency scaling will effect results) but does allow you to choose some software settings 
to make your benchmarks more (or less consistent). The structure `GenericSettings` is where to set these. 


It's not particularly lightweight at the moment - but in future should be able to fairly 
seamlessly work in -betterC (Constuctors and destructors can be done with or without druntime)
